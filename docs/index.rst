Introduction
------------

So what is libcork, exactly?  It's a “simple, easily embeddable, cross-platform
C library”.  It falls roughly into the same category as glib_ or APR_ in the C
world; the STL, POCO_, or QtCore_ in the C++ world; or the standard libraries
of any decent dynamic language.

So if libcork has all of these comparables, why a new library?  Well, none of
the C++ options are really applicable here.  And none of the C options work,
because one of the main goals is to have the library be highly modular, and
useful in resource-constrained systems.  Once we describe some of the design
decisions that we've made in libcork, you'll hopefully see how this fits into
an interesting niche of its own.
